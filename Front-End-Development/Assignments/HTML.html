        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, 
        headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.When working with HTML, we use simple 
        code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by
        placing the enclosed text within a starting &lt;p&gt; and closing &lt;/p&gt; tag.<br> 

        The History of HTML :- <br>
        HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up 
        with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to 
        other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting 
        of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes 
        (tag modifiers) to the markup.HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension.
