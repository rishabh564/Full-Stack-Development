        It all started in the year 1995 when Brendan Eich created JavaScript. It is a high level, 
        interpreted, programming language used to make web pages more interactive. To be more precise, it’s a 
        programming language that let’s you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages.JavaScript 
        was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the 
        excitement being generated by Java. <br>
        The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and 
        run automatically as the page loads.Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need 
        special preparation or compilation to run. <br>
