        Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a stylesheet language that dictates how your website elements should 
        look like. You can control the design, layout, font, and the color of your website content by embedding 
        a CSS file into your HTML document.<br> The declaration can be broken down into:          
        selector {property: value;}<br>

        As you can see, the CSS syntax consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector is the 
        HTML element that you’re about to control. Whereas the declaration block contains the property name and 
        the value of the HTML element – both of them are separated by a colon (:) and declared within curly 
        brackets ({}).<br>

        Your syntax should look like this:<br>
        h1 {font-size: 20px;}
        In this case, the selector is h1. Then, font-size is the property name, and 20px is the value.
