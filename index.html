                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: ;">Hello! everyone, Welcome to this tutorial of Full-Stack Development. 
                  Full stack web development is the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end of a program.
                  Front-end is what the users will see or interact with on your application. Back-end part is what users 
                  do not see, such as application's logic, database, server, etc. A full-stack web developer is comfortable 
                  working with both back-end and front-end technologies which make a website or application functioning properly.
                  This course is divided into 2 parts- front-end part & back-end part. Here, you will see all my assignments(practicals) done
                  in this course.
